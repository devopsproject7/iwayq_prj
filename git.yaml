Masturbation
Overthinking
Being lazy
Completing the task at the 11th hour or the deadline.
Living in your comfort zone.
Exaggerated use of social media. Instagram pages are making a lot of money. They post everything that catches your attention.
Watching pornography and web series. Stop feeding your mind with outrageous content. It will adversely affect your career.
Don't try to manage your emotions. Improper management of your reaction to emotions will not let you grow. Stop reacting to such shit any more.
Getting much into the past. it's over now. Move on.
Putting bad comments on social media. Everything is trackable. Even if you are using a fake account. Internet Protocol address (IP) does not alter. Your profile will be analyzed or scanned when you will join a good position in any company.
Involving yourself in things that are irrelevant to you.
Having too many unrealistic expectations from the wrong person.
√Ällways saying yes.
Anything in excess is waste. Don't do anything beyond the limit. Being too much ambitious and positive might not help you in your career. Be grounded and set attainable goals.
Not ready for change not even if it's a necessity.
Addiction ( social media, drug, alcohol, and cigarettes üö¨ )
You are getting affected by the opinion of others.
Comparing yourself to others.
Criticizing people and being jealous of someone's success or growth.
Unaware of the fact that karma gonna hit you hard. You get what you manifest in your mind.
Being extravagant.
Expecting your parent could do more for you. Thinking your life could be better If your parent has managed their income well.
Let me tell you one thing it's your time to pay them. He could be with his darling in his own Lamborghini but they both choose to invest in you from your childhood. Respect your parents.
Ending on a Good Note

‚Äú Be honest with yourself. Stop arguing for your limitations. Take responsibility for your own life. In this way, you can change what is not working."

Your blessings are on the way. Your silent prayer has been answered. You are going to be successful soon. üòäüôèüèª

Much love and respect for you from the writer for giving me your valuable time to read this answer to end. ‚ô•
